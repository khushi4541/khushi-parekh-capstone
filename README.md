# LevelUp

## Overview

LevelUp is an interactive and social habit tracker app that allows users to build and maintain healthy habits while staying motivated through social engagement. Users can track their progress, add friends, view each otherâ€™s achievements, and have friendly competition.

### Problem Space

Building and maintaining habits is challenging, especially without external accountability. Many habit trackers focus only on individual progress, lacking social engagement to keep users motivated. People often give up on habits due to a lack of encouragement or friendly competition. LevelUp addresses this by combining habit tracking with community support, making self-improvement more engaging and fun.
